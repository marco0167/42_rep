- Each Docker image must have the same name as its corresponding service.
- Each service has to run in a dedicated container.
- For performance matters, the containers must be built either from the penultimate stable
	version of Alpine or Debian.
- Write your own Dockerfiles, one per service.
- The Dockerfiles must be called in your docker-compose.yml by your Makefile.

Need to setup:
- A Docker container that contains NGINX with TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 only.
- A Docker container that contains WordPress + php-fpm (it must be installed and
	configured) only without nginx.
- A Docker container that contains MariaDB only without nginx.
- A volume that contains your WordPress database.
- A second volume that contains your WordPress website files.
- A docker-network that establishes the connection between your containers.
- Your containers have to restart in case of a crash.

WordPress
- In your WordPress database, there must be two users, one of them being the administrator. The administrator’s username can’t contain admin/Admin or administrator/Administrator (e.g., admin, administrator, Administrator, admin-123, and so forth)

IP address
- To make things simpler, you have to configure your domain name so it points to your local IP address.
	This domain name must be login.42.fr. Again, you have to use your own login.
	For example, if your login is wil, wil.42.fr will redirect to the IP address pointing to wil’s website.

NGINX
- Your NGINX container must be the only entrypoint into your infrastructure via the port 443 only, using the TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 protocol.
